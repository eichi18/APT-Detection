<h1>phpMyAdmin 2.6.3-pl1 official translators list</h1>

<p>
    Here is the list of the so called &quot;official translators&quot; of
    phpMyAdmin.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="important">If you want to suggest some improvements on a
    translation please ask them</span>: we (the phpMyAdmin developement team)
    don't know anything about most of these languages and then we can't have
    any opinion on grammar issues or bad translations!
</p>
<p>
    All translations listed here are included in this distribution.
    <span class="important">Please don't ask the translators to send you a
    localized phpMyAdmin version!</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="important">Please do not expect the translators to provide
    e-mail support.</span>
</p>
